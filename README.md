# Speakers Platform Telegram Mini App

This project contains a tiny Flask backend and a static frontâ€‘end written in React. It showcases speakers and their talks inside a Telegram WebApp.

Data is stored in `/data/db.json` by default (the location can be changed via the `DB_PATH` environment variable).

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000/` to see the demo cards. Visit `/admin` for the admin placeholder.

## Telegram bot

The repository also includes a simple Telegram bot in `bot.py`. The bot sends a
welcome message describing the mini app and adds a `MiniApp` button in the bot
menu that opens the web application.

Set the following environment variables before running:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<telegram bot token>
WEBAPP_URL=<url where the mini app is hosted>
```

Then start the bot with:

```bash
python bot.py
```
